        <h4>Stadium</h4>
        <p>
          Anfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park. It was originally used by Everton before the club
          moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding.Left with an empty ground,
          Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium
          at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.

          The Kop was built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment
          initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0.In 1906 the banked
          stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal.The hill was
          the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment
          died, many of them from Liverpool. At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the
          largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadia in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but
          Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football
          grounds

          Anfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak, and had a capacity of 55,000 until the
          1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Liverpool to convert Anfield to an all-seater
          stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, reducing the capacity to 45,276.The findings of the Taylor Report
          precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the
          centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish
          Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the
          ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted
          to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of
          the 1999–2000 season
