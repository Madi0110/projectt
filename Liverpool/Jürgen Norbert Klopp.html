        <h4>Jürgen Norbert Klopp </h4>
        <p>
          Jürgen Norbert Klopp born 16 June 1967 is a German football manager and former professional player who is the
          current manager of Premier League club Liverpool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Klopp spent most of his 15-year playing career at Mainz 05, before going on to become their longest-serving
          manager from 2001 to 2008, during which time they achieved promotion to the Bundesliga. In 2008, Klopp joined
          Borussia Dortmund, leading them to back-to-back Bundesliga wins in 2011 and 2012, as well as the DFB-Pokal in
          2012, the DFL-Supercup in 2013 and 2014, and their second appearance in a UEFA Champions League final in
          2013. Klopp won the German Football Manager of the Year in 2011 and 2012, before leaving Dortmund in 2015
          having also become their longest-serving manager. In October 2015, he became manager of Liverpool, whom he
          led to the finals of the League Cup and UEFA Europa League in his first season before guiding them to the
          2018 UEFA Champions League Final.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 8 October 2015, Klopp agreed a three-year deal to become Liverpool manager, replacing Brendan
          Rodgers.[63][64] During his first conference, Klopp dubbed himself 'The Normal One' as a parody of José
          Mourinho's famous 'The Special One' statement when first taking over Chelsea in 2004. His debut was a 0–0
          away draw with Tottenham Hotspur on 17 October 2015.[66] On 28 October 2015, Klopp secured his first win as
          Liverpool manager against Bournemouth in the League Cup to proceed to the quarter-finals.[67] His first
          Premier League win came three days later, a 3–1 away victory against Chelsea.After three 1–1 draws in the
          opening matches of the UEFA Europa League, Liverpool defeated Rubin Kazan with 1–0 in Klopp's first win in
          Europe as a Liverpool manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liverpool started the 2018–19 season with their best league start in the club's 126 year history, winning all
          of their first six matches. This positive trend continued as Liverpool were unbeaten going into December.
          Their good form could be attributed to their defensive record of five goals conceded in the first 14 matches
          of the season, a statistic only bettered in the Premier League era by Chelsea in the 2008–09 season.
