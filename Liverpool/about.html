          Liverpool Football Club is a professional football club in Liverpool, England, that competes in the Premier
          League, the top tier of English football. The club has won 5 European Cups, more than any other English club,
          3 UEFA Cups, 3 UEFA Super Cups, 18 League titles, 7 FA Cups, 8 League Cups, and 15 FA Community Shields.

        <p>
          Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played at Anfield since its
          formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and
          1980s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to 11 League titles and seven European trophies. Under
          the management of Rafael Benítez and captained by Steven Gerrard, Liverpool became European champions for the
          fifth time in 2005.

          Liverpool was the ninth highest-earning football club in the world in 2016–17, with an annual revenue of
          €424.2 million,and the world's eighth most valuable football club in 2018, valued at $1.944 billion.The club
          is one of the best supported teams in the world.Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United
          and Everton.

          The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies: the Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping
          fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, with 39 people –
          mostly Italians and Juventus fans – dying, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from European
          competition, and the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against
          perimeter fencing.
